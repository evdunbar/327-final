# Brainstorm
- smart irrigation device
    - program times or soil moisture level using display
- $\text{CO}_2$ detector/warning system
    - audio alert when reaching critical levels + display current ppm
- 3d space tracer using gyro/accel
- sweat electrolyte sensor/instructor
- tiny irritation device
    - small footprint, coin cell battery
    - plays random morse code messages at random times
    - short enough tones that you can't detect location
- bike pedal power detection
